# 10) DEFINITION OF THE REFERENCE DIRECTION

'''
Most studies have used the Das and Dennisâ€™s structured approach for generating well-spaced reference points.
A reference direction is constructed by a vector originating from the origin and connected to each of them. The number
of points on the unit simplex is determined by a parameter p (we call it n_partitions in our implementation), which
indicates the number of gaps between two consecutive points along an objective axis.
