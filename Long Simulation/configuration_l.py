# 10) DEFINITION OF THE REFERENCE DIRECTION

'''

Most studies have used the Das and Dennisâ€™s structured approach for generating well-spaced reference points.
A reference direction is constructed by a vector originating from the origin and connected to each of them. The number
of points on the unit simplex is determined by a parameter p (we call it n_partitions in our implementation), which
indicates the number of gaps between two consecutive points along an objective axis.

    # generates random floating-point values for the initial solutions, providing a diverse starting point.

    # selection: This defines the selection mechanism used to choose parents for reproduction.
    # TournamentSelection selects individuals based on a comparison function.
    # func_comp=comp_by_cv_then_random: This comparison function first considers constraint violations (cv) and
    # then applies a random selection if necessary. This helps prioritize feasible solutions.

    selection=TournamentSelection(func_comp=comp_by_cv_then_random),

    # crossover: This parameter specifies the crossover operator used for generating offspring.
    # SBX: Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) is a common crossover method in genetic algorithms, particularly
    # suited for real-valued variables.
    # The distribution index for SBX. A higher value of eta results in offspring closer to their
    # parents, while a lower value results in more variation.
    # The probability of crossover being applied. A probability of 1.0 means crossover is always
    # applied.

    crossover=SBX(eta=1, prob=1),

    # mutation: This parameter specifies the mutation operator used for generating variation in offspring.
    # PM: Polynomial Mutation (PM) is a common mutation method for real-valued variables.

    # while a lower value results in larger mutations.
