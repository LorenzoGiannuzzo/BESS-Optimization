        '''

        Most studies have used the Das and Dennisâ€™s structured approach for generating well-spaced reference points.
        A reference direction is constructed by a vector originating from the origin and connected to each of them. The number
        of points on the unit simplex is determined by a parameter p (we call it n_partitions in our implementation), which
        indicates the number of gaps between two consecutive points along an objective axis.
